# 3-Minute Demo Video Script

**Winning Formula: Hook → Demo → Impact**

Devpost Rule: **Only the first 3 minutes are evaluated.** Every second must earn its place.

---

## Video Requirements (Devpost Rules)

✅ **Maximum 3 minutes** (longer videos only first 3 min evaluated)
✅ **Show functioning project** on intended platform
✅ **English or English subtitles** required
✅ **Upload to YouTube** (recommended) or Vimeo
✅ **Make publicly visible** (unlisted OK, private not OK)

---

## Script Structure (180 Seconds)

### Act 1: The Hook (0:00-0:30) - 30 seconds

**Goal:** Grab judge attention in first 10 seconds

**Script:**

```
[VISUAL: FCP logo animates in]

"What if your phone could understand food like a nutritionist?"

[VISUAL: Show phone taking photo of meal]

"FCP uses 15+ Gemini 3 features to transform food photos,
voice commands, and videos into instant nutrition insights."

[VISUAL: Quick cut montage - 3 seconds each]
- Photo → Nutrition breakdown
- Voice → Meal logged
- Recipe search → Results

"In the next 3 minutes, I'll show you how Gemini's multimodal AI
powers every feature of this platform."

[VISUAL: Transition to demo]
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Start with a question (engagement)
- ✅ Mention "15+ Gemini 3 features" (differentiation)
- ✅ Show, don't tell (visuals > words)
- ✅ Promise a demo (keep watching)

**Delivery Tips:**
- Speak fast but clear (aim for 140-160 words/min)
- High energy (judge enthusiasm matters)
- No "um" or "uh" (practice 5x before recording)

---

### Act 2: The Demo (0:30-2:30) - 120 seconds

**Goal:** Show 4 features judges will remember

**Feature 1: Multimodal Image Analysis** (0:30-1:00) - 30 sec

```
[VISUAL: Open app, click camera icon]

"Let's start with Gemini's multimodal vision. I'll take a photo
of this chicken salad."

[VISUAL: Take photo with phone camera]

"Gemini analyzes the image using its multimodal API..."

[VISUAL: Loading spinner - 2 seconds]

"...and instantly breaks down nutrition, detects allergens, and
identifies every ingredient."

[VISUAL: Show results overlay on photo]
- 450 calories
- 35g protein
- ⚠️ Contains: Dairy, Gluten

"Notice the allergen warnings - Gemini detected dairy and gluten
without me telling it what to look for."

[VISUAL: Zoom in on allergen badges]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Visual proof (not just talking about it)
- Solves real problem (allergies are serious)
- Shows Gemini's intelligence (detected without prompt)

---

**Feature 2: Function Calling with MCP Tools** (1:00-1:30) - 30 sec

```
[VISUAL: Switch to voice command demo]

"Now let's use Gemini's function calling. I'll speak naturally..."

[VISUAL: Press microphone button]

"Log 3 scrambled eggs with toast and coffee."

[VISUAL: Show Gemini processing]

"Behind the scenes, Gemini is calling our MCP tools -
structured functions that enforce typed schemas."

[VISUAL: Split screen - left shows voice, right shows JSON]

Left:  "3 scrambled eggs..."
Right: {
  "tool": "log_meal",
  "params": {
    "meal_name": "Scrambled Eggs & Toast",
    "calories": 380,
    "macros": {"protein": 24, "carbs": 28, "fat": 16}
  }
}

"No parsing errors, no hallucinations - just structured data
that our system can trust."

[VISUAL: Show meal added to log]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Shows technical depth (MCP tools + function calling)
- Proves reliability (structured output)
- Demonstrates 40+ tools without listing them

---

**Feature 3: Google Search Grounding** (1:30-2:00) - 30 sec

```
[VISUAL: Switch to safety check feature]

"Food safety is critical. Let's use Gemini's grounding with
Google Search to check for recalls."

[VISUAL: Type "romaine lettuce" in search]

"Is romaine lettuce safe to eat right now?"

[VISUAL: Show Gemini processing with grounding indicator]

"Gemini searches Google in real-time..."

[VISUAL: Show FDA recall alert with sources]

⚠️ RECALL ALERT
Romaine lettuce from Farm X recalled due to E. coli
Source: FDA.gov, updated 2 days ago

"It found an active recall with citations. This isn't
hallucination - it's grounded in real FDA data."

[VISUAL: Click source link to show FDA.gov]
```

**Why This Works:**
- High impact (food safety is life-or-death)
- Shows grounding feature (judges want to see this)
- Cites sources (proves no hallucination)

---

**Feature 4: Gemini Live (Conversational)** (2:00-2:30) - 30 sec

```
[VISUAL: Switch to Gemini Live demo]

"Finally, Gemini Live enables real-time conversations.
Watch this..."

[VISUAL: Click microphone, speak naturally]

You: "I had salmon for lunch."

Gemini (audio): "Great choice! How was it prepared - grilled,
baked, or raw?"

You: "Grilled with vegetables."

Gemini: "Perfect. About how much salmon - one fillet or more?"

You: "One fillet, maybe 6 ounces."

Gemini: "Got it! Logging 6oz grilled salmon with vegetables.
That's about 350 calories. Want me to save that?"

You: "Yes."

[VISUAL: Show meal auto-logged with all details]

"Gemini Live asks clarifying questions like a real nutritionist,
then auto-fills everything based on context."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Conversational AI (impressive, modern)
- Shows bidirectional audio (Gemini Live feature)
- Natural UX (judge thinks "I would use this")

---

### Act 3: The Impact (2:30-3:00) - 30 seconds

**Goal:** Stick the landing - why this matters

**Script:**

```
[VISUAL: Return to dashboard showing 7-day meal log]

"FCP transforms manual food tracking into an intelligent
conversation. We're using 15+ Gemini 3 features:"

[VISUAL: Feature list animates in]

✅ Multimodal image & audio
✅ Function calling (40+ tools)
✅ Google Search grounding
✅ Extended thinking
✅ Code execution
✅ Gemini Live API
✅ Context caching
✅ Video processing

[VISUAL: Show both REST API and MCP interfaces side by side]

"The platform exposes both REST and MCP interfaces, making
it easy for developers to integrate."

[VISUAL: Cut to code snippet]

"Every feature is production-grade - typed schemas, error
handling, rate limiting, and 100% test coverage."

[VISUAL: Show public demo URL]

"Try it yourself at [demo-url] - no login required."

[VISUAL: FCP logo with tagline]

"FCP: AI-powered food intelligence, built on Gemini 3."

[END SCREEN with links]
- 🔗 Demo: api.fcp.dev
- 💻 Code: github.com/Food-Context-Protocol/fcp-gemini-server
- 📧 Contact: [your email]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Reinforces "15+ features" (competitive edge)
- Shows both REST + MCP (technical depth)
- Production-grade claim (with proof)
- Clear call-to-action (judges can try it)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:

1. **Long intro** - "Hi, my name is... I built this because..."
   - ✅ **Do instead:** Hook in first 10 seconds

2. **Live coding** - "Let me show you the code..."
   - ✅ **Do instead:** Show code for 3 seconds max, keep moving

3. **Apologizing** - "Sorry, this might not work..."
   - ✅ **Do instead:** Confidence! Pre-record if nervous

4. **Reading slides** - "As you can see on this slide..."
   - ✅ **Do instead:** Show, don't tell (visuals speak)

5. **Technical jargon** - "We use a RESTful CRUD API with..."
   - ✅ **Do instead:** "Users can create, read, update meals via API"

6. **Slow demos** - Wait 10 seconds for page to load...
   - ✅ **Do instead:** Speed up video during loading (1.5-2x)

7. **No audio** - Silent screencasts with captions
   - ✅ **Do instead:** Voiceover explaining what's happening

8. **Over 3 minutes** - "Just one more feature..."
   - ✅ **Do instead:** Ruthlessly cut to 2:45 (safety margin)

---

## Alternative: AI-Generated Voiceover

**If you're camera-shy:**

Use AI voiceover (sounds natural now):

1. **ElevenLabs** (https://elevenlabs.io)
   - $5/month for 30 minutes
   - Sounds like real person
   - Multiple voices

2. **Workflow:**
   - Record screen silently
   - Write script
   - Generate voiceover with ElevenLabs
   - Overlay audio in video editor

**Pros:**
- Perfect delivery every time
- No "um" or "uh"
- Easy to re-record sections

**Cons:**
- Less personal
- Costs $5
